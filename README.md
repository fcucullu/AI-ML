# Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning
During my career as a quantitative developer, I have researched and implemented many advanced mathematical models. This repository showcases some of my most used algorithms, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and tools from stochastic calculus.

# Note:
This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.

# Resourses used:
Artificial Intelligence:
- Custom genetic optimization algorithm
- Custom bayesian optimization algorithm
- Custom models of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Custom models of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

Machine Learning:
